# Spice MySQL starter

`github.com/spice-framework/starter-mysql` is the independently versioned,
opt-in MySQL integration for Spice. It creates secure, instance-owned
`database/sql` pools with the maintained go-sql-driver/mysql driver. Importing
Spice core alone never selects this driver.

```go
database, err := mysql.Open(mysql.Options{
    URL:             configuration.DatabaseURL,
    ApplicationName: "orders-service",
})
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

`Open` validates configuration and creates a caller-owned pool without network
I/O or global driver/TLS registration. `Ping` performs the explicit readiness
check with the caller's context. TLS 1.2 hostname verification is the default;
disabled TLS requires both `tls=disable` in the URL and explicit
`AllowInsecure`, which is intended only for isolated local/container tests.
Unknown driver options, incomplete identities, unbounded pool settings, and
unsafe application metadata fail before construction without exposing URLs or
passwords.

## Install

```text
go get github.com/spice-framework/starter-mysql@latest
```

During preview development, applications should pin the exact compatible
commit recorded in [support metadata](docs/support.md).

## Verify

Go 1.26.5 is mandatory:

```text
make check
make verify
make verify-release
```

The normal verifier checks formatting, module/vendor reproducibility, vet,
allowlisted lint and nil safety, gosec, govulncheck, shuffled race tests, at
least 85% product coverage, and offline vendor builds.

Real-system acceptance uses the immutable official MySQL 8.4.11 image index.
It proves two isolated pools, live queries, bounded query cancellation,
connection recovery, independent cleanup, and credential-safe authentication
failures:

```text
docker run --detach --name spice-mysql --publish 53306:3306 \
  --env MYSQL_DATABASE=spice --env MYSQL_USER=spice \
  --env MYSQL_PASSWORD=spice-test --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=spice-root \
  mysql@sha256:b3b90af2a6552ae30c266fdb7d5dd55f3afb72404bb78d37fe8a23eb857fd3fb
SPICE_MYSQL_TEST_URL='mysql://spice:spice-test@127.0.0.1:53306/spice?tls=disable' \
  make integration
docker rm --force spice-mysql
```

MySQL DDL implicitly commits, so this starter does not claim a transactional
migration backend. Applications own explicit resumable migration plans.

See [the dependency review](docs/dependency-review.md) and
[support contract](docs/support.md) before production adoption.

## Releases

The repository builds deterministic source-only releases with an SPDX 2.3
SBOM, SHA-256 checksums, and Ed25519 signatures. See the exact artifact and
clean-tag ceremony in [the release guide](docs/releasing.md).
